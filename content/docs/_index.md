#### What is Music Therapy?

According to the [American Music Therapy Association](http://www.musictherapy.org/) (2018), music therapy is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program.

Music therapy helps address individuals' social, communicative, emotional, physical, cognitive, sensory, or spiritual needs. Music therapists are certified by the [Certification Board for Music Therapists](http://www.cbmt.org/) (CBMT), and hold the credential Music Therapist - Board Certified (MT-BC).

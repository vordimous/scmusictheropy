## General Information

There are over 70 approved college and university programs that offer music therapy training in the United States. A minimum of a bachelor’s degree or equivalency is required to enter the field. During their training music therapy students take part in a demanding curriculum that focuses on the following core areas:  
• applied music study, music history, music theory/aural skills, and ensembles  
• music therapy courses (including clinical skills, research, and music psychology)  
• anatomy/physiology courses, psychology courses, and dance/movement  
• other related courses  
Throughout the course of their bachelor’s or equivalency studies, students are involved in 200 hours of field experiences. Upon completion of coursework students must complete 1000 hours of field experience in a National Roster or University-Affiliated Internship. When the internship is complete music therapists are eligible to sit for the board certification exam. Passing the examination leads to entry-level credential MT-BC (Music Therapist-Board Certified) awarded by the Certification Board of Music Therapists (CBMT). In addition, graduate degrees in Music Therapy are available.

Professional music therapists follow the standards for clinical interventions and ethical conduct in professional practice, which are defined in the following American Music Therapy Association documents: Music Therapists’ Standards of Clinical Practice, Music Therapists’ Code of Ethics, and AMTA Professional Competencies.

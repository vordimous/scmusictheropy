## Course Description

A career in music therapy can be as transformative as the musical experiences between a music therapist and client. Anchored in the instructor's career trajectory—from undergraduate training at Converse University to clinical practice, graduate education, and academic teaching—the course examines the multifaceted nature of career progression in the field. Participants will gain insight into the highs, lows, and pivotal decisions that shape a career.

Through guided reflection activities attendees will examine their own professional paths, core values, challenges, inspirations, and aspirations. The course also highlights the importance of mentorship, interdisciplinary growth, and the balance of personal and career goals, as illustrated by the instructor's journey through graduate studies, university-level teaching, and personal values.

Whether you're just beginning your career or seeking renewed direction, this course offers a space to reconnect with your purpose, celebrate your progress, and chart your next steps in music therapy.

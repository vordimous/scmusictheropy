This course brings together research in an outpatient music therapy program addressing PTSD with a music therapy program focused on clinical expertise in addiction treatment using Dialectical Behavior Therapy techniques. Participants will hear from a PhD researcher, a seasoned outpatient clinician and a music therapist working in a residential treatment program. These programs serve veterans, current service members, first-responders and the general public in addictions treatment. Suggestions for application of improvisation, listening, songwriting, and recreating music for other clinical groups will be discussed.

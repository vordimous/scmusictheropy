Participants will learn skills in prepping, facilitating, and processing group and dyadic music
therapy sessions using clinical improvisation. This CMTE is designed to encourage and empower
music therapists to build upon using improvisation interventions within sessions and using
improvisation as the primary intervention in group and dyadic sessions. Participants will have
opportunities to experience and practice their improvisational skills during experiential music
making. Discussion and practice describing improvisational interventions will help to develop
skills to document the relationship between improvisational music making and client treatment
goals.

**Learner Objectives** :
Upon completion of this CMTE, participants will

1. learn to define and use improvisation terms and determine suitable structures, tools, and
    settings for improvisation in specific clinical settings (II.D.13)
2. learn and demonstrate nonmusical and musical techniques to engage clients and how to
    listen, comprehend, and describe what is heard in the music (III.A.4.g; III.A.5.a, g, k, r, y,
    bb, ee, hh)
3. learn to recognize and describe significant aspects of improvisation experiences for
    discussion and documentation (III.B.7)

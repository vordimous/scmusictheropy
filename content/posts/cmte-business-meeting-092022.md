If music is our primary means of engaging clients in the therapeutic process, why couldn’t it be our
primary means of engaging in the research process? Arts-based inquiry (aka arts-based research)
offers music therapists the opportunity to conceptualize, design, and disseminate their research
using the arts. Music and other art forms can be used to guide research design, to refine
methodology, as data to be analyzed, as results, and as a means of communicating research findings.
Examples of these will be shared using a current arts-based study on therapeutic presence. This
interactive course will offer opportunities to explore therapeutic presence, arts-based inquiry,
design arts-based inquiries in clinical practice, and do all three with and through music.

Course evaluation will include the CMTE Course Evaluation Form and participant demonstration of
understanding during experiential components of this course.

**Learner Objectives** :

1. Participants will learn and practice at least two strategies for enhancing therapeutic
   presence with clients. (III.A.1)
2. Participants will be able to articulate at least two ways they musically communicate
   therapeutic presence with clients. (III.A.5.hh)
3. Participants will be able to identify at least one way they can apply arts-based inquiry to
   their clinical practice. (V.A.1)

There are no prerequisites to attend this CMTE event. Students are welcome and encouraged to
come and learn with MT-BCs.

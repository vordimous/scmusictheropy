## Course Description

Musical themes are the "playing field" for musical interaction in which clients are provided with opportunities to engage and express. Through the creation of themes that are built around the client's musical, behavioral, and/or emotional cues clients may experience empathy, predictability and feelings of safety that can enhance the relational music-making-dynamic experience. This course explores the intersection between the clinical and non-clinical music making process in terms of the music therapist crafting meaningful themes that serve as a foundation for providing clients with opportunities for engagement.

This course will provide participants with a practical guide to crafting musical themes with clinical intent. Topical areas include: 
1. developing repeatable melodic themes with voice and guitar/piano accompaniment, 
2. solidifying themes to construct musical form, such as A-B-A, 
3. employing clinical techniques of empathy and elicitation within the musical process of crafting themes, and 
4. navigating shifts between client-led and therapist-led initiatives to construct musical form such as A-B-A

Clinical video, demonstration, and experientially based learning will be used throughout the course to illustrate concepts and practice techniques.

## Learner Objectives

Upon completion of this CMTE, participants will be able to:

1. **Identify and apply** at least 2 clinical improvisation techniques regarding empathy, redirection, and elicitation techniques using repletion and variation to develop musical themes in therapeutic contexts (CBMT III.5.a.g,o,r,y,bb).

2. **Demonstrate the ability** to structure an "A" section based on client-led clinical techniques and in-the-moment reflexivity and to structure a "B" section based on therapist-led techniques and in-the-moment reflexivity (CBMT III.5,a.g,o,r,y,bb).

3. **Demonstrate the ability** to name musical qualities that differentiate between "A" and "B" sections in clinical improvisation, articulating when and how to transition from client-led to therapist-led approaches to support therapeutic goals (CBMT III.5.a,k,r,y,ee,hh).

4. **Design** an A-B-A musical form that reflects intentional shifts between client-led and therapist-led initiatives, demonstrating techniques of elicitation and redirection to deepen the musical and therapeutic experience (CBMT III.5.a,g.o.r.y.bb).

**Prerequisites:** There are no prerequisites to attend this CMTE event. Students are welcome and encouraged to come and learn with MT-BCs.
